## Prerequisites

- A Havoc account at [usehavoc.com](https://usehavoc.com)
- At least one AI provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google)

## Step 1: Sign Up and Create an Organization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Go to [usehavoc.com](https://usehavoc.com) and sign up with your email or Google account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Organization">
    After signing in, create your organization. This is your team workspace where all agents and billing are managed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure a Provider

Before creating an agent, you need to configure at least one AI model provider.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Providers">
    Go to **Settings > Providers** in the Havoc dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API Key">
    Select your provider (e.g., Anthropic) and enter your API key. Havoc encrypts all keys at rest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify the API key works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  We recommend **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5** as the primary model for the best balance of intelligence and speed.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Create Your First Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Agent">
    Click **+ New Agent** from the dashboard or use a pre-built template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Set the agent name, select a model, and customize the workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Deploy**. Havoc spins up a secure Docker container with an OpenClaw gateway for your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Connect a Channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Channel">
    Go to your agent's **Channels** tab and click **Connect Channel**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Platform">
    Select from WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, or others.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Follow the platform-specific setup (e.g., scan QR code for WhatsApp, enter bot token for Telegram).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Send a message to your agent through the connected channel. You can also use the **Live Chat** in the Havoc dashboard to test directly.
