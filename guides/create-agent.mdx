## Overview

This guide walks you through creating an agent from scratch or from a template.

## Option A: Create from Template

Templates are the fastest way to get started. They pre-configure workspace files, model selection, and tool policy.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Templates">
    From the dashboard, click **+ New Agent** and select **Browse Templates**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Template">
    Select a template that matches your use case:
    - **Customer Support** — FAQ handling, ticket routing, escalation
    - **Sales Agent** — Lead qualification, appointment booking
    - **Research Agent** — Web research, report generation
    - **Personal Assistant** — Calendar, reminders, task management
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize">
    Modify the agent name, model, and workspace files as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Deploy**. Your agent will be running in seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option B: Create from Scratch

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Blank Agent">
    Click **+ New Agent** and select **Blank Agent**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Basic Configuration">
    Set the following:
    - **Name** — A descriptive name for the agent
    - **Model** — Select primary model and optional fallbacks
    - **Description** — Brief description of the agent's purpose
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Workspace">
    Edit the workspace files to define agent behavior:

    **AGENTS.md** — Operating instructions and priorities

    ```markdown
    # Instructions
    You are a customer support agent for Acme Corp.
    - Be helpful and professional
    - Escalate complex issues to human support
    ```

    **SOUL.md** — Persona and communication style

    ```markdown
    # Persona
    Friendly, professional, and efficient.
    Use simple language. Be empathetic.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool Policy">
    Configure which tools the agent can use:
    - **Web Search** — Enable for agents that need current information
    - **Browser** — Enable for interactive web research
    - **File System** — Enable for agents that manage documents
    - **Exec** — Enable with caution for agents that run commands
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Deploy** to spin up the agent's Docker container.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Settings

After creation, you can configure additional settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Heartbeat** | Periodic check-in interval (default: 30 minutes) |
| **Sandbox** | Docker sandboxing mode (off, non-main, all) |
| **Block Streaming** | Send responses as streaming blocks |
| **Thinking Level** | Reasoning depth (off, minimal, low, medium, high) |
| **Session Scope** | DM session isolation (main, per-peer, per-channel-peer) |

## API: Create Agent

You can also create agents via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.usehavoc.com/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Support Agent",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "templateId": "customer-support"
  }'
```
