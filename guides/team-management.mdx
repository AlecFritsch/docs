## Overview

Havoc organizations support multiple team members with role-based access control.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access — billing, members, agents, settings |
| **Admin** | Manage agents, channels, providers, and team members |
| **Member** | View and interact with agents, view analytics |

## Invite Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Organization Settings">
    Go to **Settings > Organization > Members**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite">
    Click **Invite Member**, enter their email address, and select a role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept Invitation">
    The invited member receives an email with a link to join the organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manage Members

From the Members page, you can:
- **Change roles** — Promote or demote team members
- **Remove members** — Revoke access immediately
- **Transfer ownership** — Transfer the owner role to another admin

## API Keys

Team members can generate personal API keys for programmatic access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to **Settings > API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Key">
    Click **Generate API Key**. The key starts with `agx_` and is shown only once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the Key">
    Include the key in the `Authorization` header:
    ```bash
    curl https://usehavoc.com/api/agents \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer agx_your_api_key"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  API keys require a **Professional** plan or higher. Store keys securely — they provide full API access.
