## Overview

Providers are the AI services that power your agents. You need at least one configured provider before creating an agent.

## Add a Provider

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Providers">
    Go to **Settings > Providers** in the Havoc dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Provider">
    Choose from the list of supported providers:
    - Anthropic
    - OpenAI
    - Google (Gemini)
    - OpenRouter
    - Groq
    - Mistral
    - xAI
    - And more
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Key">
    Paste your API key. All keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify the key is valid and the provider is reachable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recommended Setup

For the best experience, we recommend configuring at least two providers for fallback:

| Role | Recommended | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Primary** | Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Best balance of intelligence, speed, and cost |
| **Fallback** | OpenAI GPT-5.2 | Reliable alternative with broad capabilities |

## Per-Agent Provider Override

Each agent can override the organization-wide provider settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Agent Settings">
    Navigate to your agent and click **Configuration**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model Selection">
    Under **Model**, select a different primary model or add agent-specific fallbacks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The agent will use its own model configuration instead of the organization default.
  </Step>
</Steps>
