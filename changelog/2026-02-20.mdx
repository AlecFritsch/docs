## Channels — Prod-Ready & Live-Status

### Live-Status-Polling
Channel status is now refreshed every 12 seconds when the agent is running and channels are connected. The UI shows real-time connection state and error messages.

### Extended Channel Support
- **Microsoft Teams** — App ID, App Secret, Tenant ID (optional for single-tenant)
- **Google Chat** — Service Account JSON
- **Mattermost** — Server URL and Bot Token
- **LINE** — Channel Access Token and Channel Secret
- **Feishu/Lark** — App ID and App Secret

### UX Improvements
- Loading skeletons instead of plain text
- Retry button with loading state on load errors
- ESC key and backdrop click to close modals
- Async loading states for Disconnect, Approve/Reject, Add Channel, Save Config
- Credential validation: `tenantId` optional for MS Teams, `appToken` optional for Slack
- Full i18n (DE/EN) for all channel UI text

### Backend
- `channels/status` response normalized to a consistent array with `type`, `connected`, `status`, `error`
- `allowFrom` included in channel status response
- Gateway reachability detection when agent runs but gateway is unavailable

## Thinking-Label — Generative

The chat "thinking" indicator is now generated dynamically via API instead of hardcoded strings. The backend endpoint `POST /api/ai/generate-thinking-label` produces context-aware labels (e.g. "Wird eingeloggt…", "Suche…") based on the user's last message.

## TOOLS.md — Browser Rule

When users say "im Browser", "browser", or "mit dem Browser", the agent now uses the **browser** tool instead of `web_search`. This rule is applied in the generated workspace TOOLS.md.

## OpenClaw Secure — Docker Patches

Two new build-time patches for containerized deployments:

- **patch-docker-device-local** — Docker bridge IPs (172.16–31) treated as "local" for device pairing; browser tool connects without manual approval
- **patch-docker-pairing-silent** — First-time device pairing auto-approved for browser tool

## Documentation

- New `docs/CHANNELS.md` in the agenix repo with full channel overview
- `CHANGELOG.md` added at project root
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/README.md` updated
- `deploy/README.md` documents `update-all.sh` for full-stack updates
