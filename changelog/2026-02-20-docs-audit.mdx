## Pricing Alignment

Plans table and billing guide updated to match the live app:

| Plan | Agents | Channels | Price |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Trial** | 1 | All | €0 for 7 days |
| **Professional** | Pay per agent | All 13+ | €75/agent/month |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Contact us |

- Removed obsolete Starter (€99) and Professional (€299) tier descriptions
- Trial FAQ: Now states 7-day free trial, no credit card required
- Usage table: Trial / Professional / Enterprise columns aligned with actual limits

## Channels

### WebChat Added
- **WebChat** documented as the built-in channel — no credentials, available in the agent's Workspace tab
- Added to both concepts/channels and guides/connect-channel

### Channel Setup Details
- **MS Teams**: App ID, App Secret, Tenant ID (optional for single-tenant) — replaces generic "Plugin installation"
- **Google Chat**: Service Account JSON — replaces "Plugin"
- **Mattermost**: Server URL + Bot Token
- **LINE**: Channel Access Token + Channel Secret
- **Feishu/Lark**: App ID + App Secret

### UI Consistency
- Replaced "Connect Channel" with **+ Add Channel** throughout guides to match the app
- Quickstart, connect-channel guide, and step descriptions updated

## Navigation & Paths

Aligned documentation with actual app routes:

| Doc Said | Updated To |
|----------|------------|
| Settings > Organization > Members | Team (sidebar) or Organization > Members |
| Settings > API Keys | Settings > API Keys section |
| Settings > Billing | Billing (sidebar) or Settings |
| Live Chat in dashboard | Workspace tab (built-in WebChat) |

## API URLs

All example `curl` commands now use `https://api.usehavoc.com` instead of `https://usehavoc.com/api` for consistency with the OpenAPI spec and production setup.

- Configure Provider guide
- Create Agent guide
- Team Management (API Keys example)

## Quickstart

- Step 5: Clarified that the Workspace tab provides built-in WebChat for testing without an external channel
- Add Channel step: Uses "+ Add Channel" wording

## Credits & AI Usage

Billing FAQ and usage sections note that AI model costs are billed by the provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.). Havoc includes AI credits with plans; additional credits can be purchased.
