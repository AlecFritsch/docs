## Introducing Agentic Payments

Every agent now gets its own crypto wallet — auto-provisioned on deploy via [Sponge](https://paysponge.com). Agents can autonomously pay for services, process checkouts, and manage funds across multiple chains.

### Supported Chains
Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Solana, Sepolia, Base-Sepolia, Solana-Devnet, Hyperliquid

### Payment Page
New dedicated `/agents/:id/payment` page in the agent dashboard:
- **Wallet Card** — Live balance display with chain breakdown and wallet address
- **Fund Wallet** — Top up via Sponge claim URL or by sending crypto directly to the wallet address
- **Copy Address** — One-click copy of the agent's wallet address
- **Transaction History** — Recent transactions with status, chain, and amount
- **Checkout Log** — All agent-initiated checkouts (e.g. Amazon purchases)
- **Service Discovery** — Browse x402-compatible services the agent can pay for

### Backend
- `GET /api/sponge/balance` — Wallet balances per chain
- `GET /api/sponge/history` — Transaction history
- `GET /api/sponge/checkouts` — Checkout history
- `GET /api/sponge/services` — x402 service discovery
- Wallet auto-registered on agent deploy, reused on redeploy
- `sponge-wallet` skill auto-enabled in OpenClaw gateway via ClawHub

## Team Invitations

Invite team members to your organization via email, powered by Resend.

- Send invitations from the Organization page
- Invitees receive an email with a one-click accept link
- Revoke pending invitations at any time
- Backend routes: `POST /api/invitations`, `POST /api/invitations/:id/accept`, `DELETE /api/invitations/:id`

## OpenClaw Fork — Native Docker Support

Migrated from patched OpenClaw to our own fork (`openclaw-fork`) with native Docker support.

- **No more build-time patches** — Device-local pairing and silent auto-approval are now native
- Docker image existence check and automated build process on deploy
- Cleaner entrypoint with improved ClawHub skill installation
- Updated container management via Dockerode

## Superchat Proactive Messaging

Agents can now send proactive messages through Superchat channels — not just respond to incoming messages.

- Internal Superchat webhook routes for agent-to-channel communication
- Proactive message delivery via `POST /api/internal/superchat/proactive`

## Improvements

- **Agent Skills** — Better error handling for skill configuration requirements
- **Channel Login** — Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- **Settings** — Audit tab availability updated
- **Navigation** — Agent navbar reordered: Overview → Workspace → Payment → Persona → Configure → Channels → Skills → Knowledge
- **Per-Agent Analytics** — Analytics filtering per individual agent

## Housekeeping

- Removed unused middleware and response schemas
- Removed obsolete configuration and documentation files
- Updated package dependencies
- Updated OpenClaw version and backend environment configuration
