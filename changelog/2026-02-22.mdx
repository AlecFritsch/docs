## Introducing Agentic Payments

Agents can now handle payments on their own. Every agent gets its own wallet — automatically set up when you deploy. No card details in the chat, no data leaks. The agent pays directly through its secure wallet without sensitive payment information ever appearing in the conversation.

Supports both blockchain-based and traditional payment methods, including a **virtual debit card** (coming soon) — so agents can shop anywhere cards are accepted.

### Payment Page
A new dedicated Payment page per agent in the dashboard:
- **Wallet Card** — Live balance overview across all supported chains
- **Fund Wallet** — Top up directly from the dashboard
- **Transaction History** — See every payment the agent has made
- **Checkout Log** — Track purchases and service payments
- **Service Discovery** — Browse services the agent can pay for autonomously

### Supported Chains
Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Solana, Hyperliquid (+ testnets)

## Team Invitations

Invite team members to your organization via email.

- Send invitations from the Organization page
- One-click accept link for invitees
- Revoke pending invitations at any time

## Proactive Messaging

Agents can now reach out first — sending proactive messages through connected channels instead of only responding to incoming messages.

## Improvements

- Better error handling when configuring agent skills
- Improved feedback during channel login
- Agent navigation reordered for faster access: Overview → Workspace → Payment
- Per-agent analytics filtering

## Coming Soon

- **Virtual Debit Card** — A real card per agent for online purchases, anywhere cards are accepted
