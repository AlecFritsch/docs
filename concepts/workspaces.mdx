## What is a Workspace?

Every agent in Havoc has a **workspace** — a collection of markdown files that define the agent's behavior, persona, tools, and memory. These files are injected into the agent's context on every interaction.

## Workspace Files

| File | Purpose | Auto-injected |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Operating instructions, memory rules, priorities | Yes |
| **SOUL.md** | Persona, tone, communication style, boundaries | Yes |
| **TOOLS.md** | Local tool notes and conventions | Yes |
| **IDENTITY.md** | Agent name, vibe, emoji | Yes |
| **USER.md** | User profile, preferences, how to address them | Yes |
| **MEMORY.md** | Curated long-term memory (main session only) | Yes |
| **HEARTBEAT.md** | Optional heartbeat checklist | Yes |
| **BOOTSTRAP.md** | One-time first-run ritual (deleted after use) | Yes |

<Warning>
  Each workspace file is limited to **20,000 characters** by default (`bootstrapMaxChars`). Keep files concise and focused.

## AGENTS.md — The Brain

This is the most important file. It defines how your agent operates:

```markdown
# Operating Instructions

## Priority 1: Customer Support
- Always greet users by name if known
- Escalate billing issues to human support
- Never share internal system details

## Priority 2: Memory
- Save important user preferences to MEMORY.md
- Log daily interactions to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md

## Priority 3: Tools
- Use web_search for current information
- Use browser for interactive research
- Never execute destructive commands
```

## SOUL.md — The Persona

Define how your agent communicates:

```markdown
# Persona

You are Alex, a friendly and professional customer support agent.

## Tone
- Warm but efficient
- Use simple language, avoid jargon
- Be empathetic when users are frustrated

## Boundaries
- Never pretend to be human
- Always disclose you are an AI assistant
- Redirect medical/legal questions to professionals
```

## Memory System

Havoc agents have a two-tier memory system:

### MEMORY.md (Curated)
- Injected into every conversation
- Contains important facts, preferences, and notes
- Managed by the agent or manually edited

### memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (Daily Logs)
- NOT auto-injected (retrieved on demand via `memory_search`)
- Contains timestamped daily interaction logs
- Searchable via vector memory search

### Vector Memory Search

Havoc builds a vector index over all memory files for semantic search. This allows agents to recall relevant information even from old daily logs.

## Editing Workspace Files

You can edit workspace files in three ways:

1. **Havoc Dashboard** — Visual editor with live preview
2. **API** — `PUT /api/agents/:agentId/workspace/:filename`
3. **Agent Self-Edit** — The agent can modify its own workspace files using the `write` tool

<Tip>
  Start with a template — it pre-configures all workspace files for common use cases like customer support, sales, or research.
