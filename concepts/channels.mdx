## What are Channels?

Channels are the messaging platforms that your agents connect to. Each channel provides a bridge between your users and the AI agent.

When your agent is running, channel status is polled every 12 seconds and shown live in the dashboard (connected, error, error message).

## Supported Channels

| Channel | Protocol | Setup |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **WhatsApp** | Baileys (Web) | QR code scan |
| **Telegram** | grammY Bot API | Bot token from @BotFather |
| **Discord** | discord.js | Bot token from Discord Developer Portal |
| **Slack** | Socket Mode / HTTP | Slack App with Bot Token |
| **Signal** | Signal CLI | Phone number registration |
| **iMessage** | imsg CLI (macOS) | macOS node required |
| **Google Chat** | Google Workspace | Service account |
| **Mattermost** | Plugin | Plugin installation |
| **MS Teams** | Plugin | Plugin installation |
| **LINE** | Messaging API | Channel access token |
| **Feishu/Lark** | Bot API | App credentials |

## DM Policy

Each channel has a DM (direct message) policy that controls who can message the agent:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **pairing** (default) | Unknown senders receive a pairing code for approval |
| **allowlist** | Only senders in the `allowFrom` list can message |
| **open** | Anyone can message (requires `allowFrom: ["*"]`) |
| **disabled** | All DMs are ignored |

## Group Policy

For group chats, channels have a separate group policy:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **open** | All senders in the group are allowed |
| **allowlist** (default) | Only senders in `groupAllowFrom` |
| **disabled** | No group chat support |

## Channel Configuration Example

Here is an example Telegram channel configuration:

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "enabled": true,
    "botToken": "123456:ABC-DEF...",
    "dmPolicy": "pairing",
    "allowFrom": ["tg:123456789"]
  }
}
```

## Per-Agent Channels

Each agent can have its own channel connections. This means:
- Agent A can be connected to WhatsApp Account 1
- Agent B can be connected to WhatsApp Account 2
- Both agents can share the same Telegram bot, routed via bindings

## Media Support

Channels support media attachments:

**Inbound:** Images, audio, video, and documents are received and stored as temp files. Audio is automatically transcribed.

**Outbound:** Agents can send media by including `MEDIA:<path-or-url>` in their response.

| Channel | Image Limit | Audio/Video | Documents |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| WhatsApp | ~6 MB | 16 MB | 100 MB |
| Telegram | 10 MB | 50 MB | 50 MB |
| Discord | 25 MB | 25 MB | 25 MB |
