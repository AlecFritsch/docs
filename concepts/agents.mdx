## What is an Agent?

An agent in Havoc is an **autonomous AI entity** that runs inside a secure Docker container. Each agent has its own [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) gateway, workspace, memory, and channel connections.

Agents can:
- Respond to messages from any connected channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.)
- Execute tools (web search, file operations, browser automation, etc.)
- Maintain long-term memory across conversations
- Run scheduled tasks via cron jobs
- Spawn sub-agents for complex workflows

## Agent Lifecycle

```
Template (optional)
    |
    v
Create Agent --> Configure --> Deploy --> Running
                                            |
                                    [ Pause / Resume / Delete ]
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Created** | Agent configuration exists but container is not running. |
| **Deploying** | Docker container is being provisioned. |
| **Running** | Agent is active and processing messages. |
| **Paused** | Container is stopped but configuration is preserved. |
| **Error** | Container failed to start or crashed. |

## Agent Configuration

Each agent has an extensive configuration with 80+ fields, organized into sections:

### Model Configuration

Select the primary AI model and fallbacks:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "primary": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "fallbacks": ["openai/gpt-5.2"]
  }
}
```

**Supported providers:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, xAI, Ollama, and many more.

### Workspace Files

Every agent has a workspace with markdown files that define its behavior:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Operating instructions, priorities, memory rules |
| **SOUL.md** | Persona, tone, boundaries |
| **TOOLS.md** | Local tool notes and conventions |
| **IDENTITY.md** | Agent name, vibe, emoji |
| **USER.md** | User profile, how to address the user |
| **MEMORY.md** | Curated long-term memory |

### Tool Policy

Control which tools the agent can use:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "allow": [],
    "deny": ["group:automation"],
    "elevated": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

Tool groups include: `group:runtime`, `group:fs`, `group:web`, `group:ui`, `group:sessions`, `group:memory`, `group:messaging`, `group:automation`, `group:nodes`.

## Templates

Havoc provides pre-built templates for common use cases:
- **Customer Support Agent** — Handles tickets, FAQs, and escalations
- **Sales Agent** — Lead qualification and appointment booking
- **Research Agent** — Web research and report generation
- **Personal Assistant** — Calendar, reminders, and task management

Templates pre-configure the workspace files, model selection, and tool policy for each use case.

## Multi-Agent

Havoc supports running multiple agents with independent configurations:
- Each agent has its own Docker container, workspace, and sessions
- Agents can be routed to different channels via bindings
- Sub-agents can be spawned for background tasks
